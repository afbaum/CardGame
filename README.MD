This is a basic simulation of the card game Sheaphead.  Sheaphead is an old Polish pesants game which is one of my family traditions.  

The object of the game is to get as many points as possible.  You ear points by winning a round or "trick".  Aces are worth 11 points, 10's worth 10, Kings worth 4, Queens worth 3 and Jacks woth 2 points.  You win the trick by playing the highest card.  

The cards are ranked from highest to lowest in the following order.
